# SRGAN and SRResNet: Super-Resolution using GANs

This is a complete Pytorch implementation of [Christian Ledig et al: "Photo-Realistic Single Image Super-Resolution Using a Generative Adversarial Network"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04802).

Pretrained checkpoints and setup instructions will be provided soon.
